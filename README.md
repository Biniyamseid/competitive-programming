# Competitive Programming Repository README

Welcome to my Competitive Programming Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my solutions to various algorithm and data structure problems, as well as a documentation of my journey in learning algorithms and honing my problem-solving skills.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- **Algorithm Implementations:** Solutions to algorithmic problems covering a wide range of topics such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.
- **Data Structure Implementations:** Implementations of fundamental data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and more.
- **Problem Solutions:** Solutions to algorithm and data structure problems sourced from popular platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.
- **Learning Resources:** Documentation, notes, and resources I've used in my journey of learning algorithms and competitive programming.

## Why Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming serves as a platform for honing problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency. By actively participating in competitions and solving algorithmic challenges, I aim to enhance my abilities in:

- Analyzing problem statements and identifying underlying patterns.
- Formulating efficient algorithms and data structures to solve problems optimally.
- Implementing solutions in various programming languages, including but not limited to Python, C++, and Java.
- Testing and debugging solutions to ensure correctness and efficiency.
